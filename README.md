2. **Choose the latest version.** Look for the most recent version at the top of the page. 

3. **Download the package.** Click on the file that matches your operating system to download it. 

4. **Install the software.** Follow your operating system’s instructions for installing downloaded files. This may involve opening the file and following prompts. 

## 🚀 Running the Application
Once installed, you can launch garbage_collector easily:

1. **Open your command line interface.** This can be Terminal on macOS and Linux or Command Prompt on Windows.
  
2. **Navigate to the software folder.** Change your directory to where you installed garbage_collector. You can do this by typing `cd path_to_garbage_collector`.

3. **Run the application.** Type the following command:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
   The output will display:
   - Initial allocation of 5 objects
   - Collection freeing 2 unreachable objects
   - New allocation reusing a freed slot

## ✨ Features
- **Automatic Memory Management:** The software helps track and free memory without needing user input.
- **Efficient Processing:** It optimally manages memory to enhance performance.
- **Custom Heap Allocation:** This allows flexible object management where memory needs are specific.

## 🔍 How It Works
The garbage_collector uses a two-phase algorithm:

1. **Mark Phase:** It begins with root objects and marks everything reachable. This ensures that only necessary data is preserved.

2. **Sweep Phase:** The software checks the heap and frees any unmarked areas. This cleans up memory automatically.

## 📚 Code Overview
The code is written entirely in Rust. It does not rely on external libraries, making it lightweight. The project implements a simple heap to manage memory effectively.

## 🤔 Why Use This Tool?
Even though Rust does not need garbage collection, understanding how it works can be beneficial. This project allows you to explore and learn about memory management in programming.

By using garbage_collector, you can deepen your understanding of programming concepts. It demonstrates how we can build complex systems from the ground up.
